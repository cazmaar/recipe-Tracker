# recipe-Tracker
Hello,
Over the Christmas break I went out to eat with some friends and the service was really bad and the meal wasn't nice. So i thought it was a good idea to build an app that 
that helps me keep track of my restaurant visits.
In this app you also get to give eacj restaurant a rating. So you can aslo recommend your favorite restaurants to your friends.

# Skill Used.
For this project, I made use of some of the skills I have been learning over the past few weeks. I used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT and Node.js. For my database i used a postgressSQL 
database.
I also created a rest Api so that the front-end and the back-end could communicate.

# Challenges
I would say the most challenging part of this project was inputing datas into my tables in the database. This was beacasue I was storing a lot of information and i had more than 
one table in my database.

lastly, In the future i am going to write my unit tests and integration test just to make sure everything works as it should.

Any recommendations and advise are welcome.

Thank you.
